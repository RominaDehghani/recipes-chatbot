# üç≤ Delicious Recipe Assistant

This project implements an AI-powered recipe recommendation system utilizing Streamlit for the frontend, a pre-processed recipe dataset, and the Google Gemini API for intent recognition and generative recipe suggestions.

## üéØ Project Objective

The primary objective is to provide users with efficient and relevant recipe recommendations based on provided ingredients. The system aims to enhance kitchen productivity by:

*   Facilitating quick discovery of recipes matching available ingredients.
*   Leveraging generative AI to propose novel or adapted recipe ideas.
*   Streamlining the meal planning and cooking process.

## üìä Dataset

The core of the recommendation system relies on a `13k-recipes.csv` dataset. This dataset is structured with the following key attributes:

*   **Title**: Recipe name.
*   **Ingredients**: Comma-separated list of primary ingredients.
*   **Instructions**: Step-by-step preparation guidelines.
*   **Cleaned_Ingredients**: A pre-processed, tokenized, and lowercased version of ingredients used for vectorization.

**Note**: In the absence of `13k-recipes.csv`, the application gracefully degrades to a smaller, in-memory sample dataset for continued functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology and Technologies

The system integrates several components and techniques:

1.  **Frontend (Streamlit)**: Provides an interactive, chatbot-like web interface. Custom CSS is applied for aesthetic enhancements and chat bubble alignment.
2.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
    *   **TF-IDF Vectorization (`TfidfVectorizer`)**: Transforms `Cleaned_Ingredients` from the dataset and user input into numerical TF-IDF feature vectors. This enables semantic comparison of ingredient lists.
    *   **Cosine Similarity**: Computes the cosine similarity between the user's input vector and the TF-IDF matrix of the recipe dataset (`X`), identifying the most semantically similar recipes.
3.  **Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)**:
    *   **Intent Recognition**: A prompt-based approach is used to classify user input as either a "recipe/ingredient query" or not. This ensures the assistant responds appropriately to non-recipe-related questions. The check involves looking for both "NO" and absence of "YES" in the Gemini response to improve robustness.
    *   **Generative Recipe Formulation**: When the retrieval component yields no direct matches, or when detailed guidance is required, Gemini generates a recipe by synthesizing information based on the user's input and optionally, the nearest available recipes. The output is formatted with HTML tags (`<h3>`, `<b>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`) for structured presentation.
4.  **Data Handling (Pandas)**: Utilized for efficient loading, cleaning, and manipulation of the recipe dataset.
5.  **Environment Management (`dotenv`)**: Securely loads API keys and other sensitive configurations from a `.env` file.

## ‚ú® Key Features and Outcomes

*   **Robust Intent-Based Interaction**: Proactively filters non-recipe-related queries, preventing irrelevant responses and maintaining conversational focus.
*   **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**: Combines a TF-IDF/Cosine Similarity-based retrieval system with a large language model (LLM) for both exact matching and generative capabilities.
*   **Dynamic Content Generation**: Leverages Gemini's generative power to create contextually relevant recipe suggestions, even for novel ingredient combinations.
*   **Structured Output**: Recipes are presented in a well-formatted HTML structure, improving readability and user comprehension.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Utilizes Streamlit's `@st.cache_data` decorator for efficient data loading and vectorizer initialization, coupled with a fast Gemini model for low-latency API calls.
*   **Fault Tolerance**: Includes graceful fallback mechanisms (e.g., sample dataset if CSV is missing, mock API response if Gemini is unavailable).

This project exemplifies the integration of traditional NLP techniques with state-of-the-art generative AI to build a practical and intelligent assistant.
